# Bill Splitter

## Overview
We built this project because we faced problems splitting our bill in Splitwise. Using this web-based splitter, we can now easily split an item's price, whether it is between 2 people or 4 people. Just by selecting the person's name, you can quickly split the bill.

## Features
- Set a total bill amount.
- Record individual payments.
- Calculate and display the remaining balance.
- Show transactions in a table.
- Display final amount owed by each person.
- Reset all data for a new bill.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Future Enhancements
- **Add dynamic add and remove friend feature.**
- **Add a Share button to share the final bill split to Splitwise.**
  - Since this project doesn't have a database, this will make it easy to maintain.
  - We will share this bill using the Splitwise API.
